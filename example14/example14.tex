  \noindent This is the beginning of a poem
    by ``Edgar Allan Poe``:

  \begin{center}
    \emph{Annabel Lee}
  \end{center}

  \begin{center}
    It was any and may a year ago, \\
    In a kingdowm by the sea, \\
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know \\
    By the name of Annabel Lee
  \end{center}

    \TeX\ has the best output. What you end with,
    the symbols on the page, is as useable, and beautiful,
    as a non-professional can produce.
